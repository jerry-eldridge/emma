ellipse.pgm --h0--> r0.pgm --downsample--> y0.pgm (Save)

y0.pgm --upsample--> t0.pgm --f0--> v0.pgm (Load)

Note that ellipse.pgm is 500 x 500 or 974KB
as a PGM P2 file. y0.pgm and t0.pgm both
are 487KB. v0 is nearly the same as ellipse.pgm
but a little loss in quality occured.

If you stored the image ellipse.pgm as y0.pgm
it seems you've compressed from 974KB to 487KB.

What is called Analysis is the Save operation then
and Synthesis the Load operation.

You would load y0.pgm in an program that read
the y0.pgm file, then did synthesis to create v0.pgm.
And display v0.pgm in the image viewer or editor. 

Doing this compresses the storage space by 2,
going from 974KB to half that at 487KB but lossy
compression. The quality of v0.pgm is slightly lower
than ellipse.pgm.
