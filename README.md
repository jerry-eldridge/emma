Emma is a C++ Graphics Library based on image structures int *img  and double *img. 

Emma\lib and Emma\include allow commands to manipulate (and save as
images) the image structures.

You can save int *img, double *img, color *img or ColorImage *img to PGM (grayscale), PPM (color), or with the Gnuwin JPG library to JPG.
